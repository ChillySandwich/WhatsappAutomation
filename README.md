# WhatsappAutomation

Followed a basic tutorial which utilises Twilio, AWS Lambda, and Whatsapp to send automated messages to contacts.

Uses a basic python script, which requires a Twilio registration and operates off the Twilio sandbox.

This script can then be imported into AWS, where you are able to set up a Lambda function to automate your whatsapp messages (provided your friends or family add the Twilio sandbox to their contacts, on Whatsapp!)
